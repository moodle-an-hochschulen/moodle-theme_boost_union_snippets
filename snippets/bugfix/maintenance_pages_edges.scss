/**
 * Snippet Title: Maintenance pages with proper edges
 * Scope:         global
 * Goal:          bugfix
 * Description:   The Moodle maintenance page layout (which is particularly used to present the Moodle database upgrade wizard) suffers from a layout bug that the content area does not have proper edges. This becomes visible as soon as the Moodle site uses a background image. This snippet fixes the issue by adding rounded corners and some paddings.
 * Creator:       Alexander Bias
 * Tracker issue: MDL-85915
 * Tested on:     Moodle 5.0, Firefox for Mac
