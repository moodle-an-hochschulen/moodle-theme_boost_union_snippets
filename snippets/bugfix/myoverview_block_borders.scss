/**
 * Snippet Title: Course overview block on Dashboard with proper borders
 * Scope:         global
 * Goal:          bugfix
 * Description:   If you place the 'Course overview' block on the Dashboard, you will see that it is not presented equally to other blocks on the Dashboard. It lacks borders and it has a surplus line below the heading. This snippet fixes this glitch and presents the course overview block similar to the other Dashboard blocks.
 * Creator:       Alexander Bias
 * Tracker issue: MDL-85944
 * Tested on:     Moodle 5.0, Firefox for Mac
